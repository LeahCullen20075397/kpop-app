Basic Kpop events app, which allows a user to add an event to a 
list of events. These events can be liked and commented on. The
comments can also be liked. Events can be deleted and added.

Features:
    basic routing
    interactive and dynamic behaviour
    part-CRUD functionality
    data model: stub API; 2 entities
    storybook support

Bugs:
    storybook shows warning about using outside functions. This
    occurred when I imported the <Link> tag. There is no issues when running the developer tool npm.
